# Mixture modelling

Data and codes for replicating the analyses in Section IV (Analysis of Seroprevalence Data), Chap. 6 (Mixture Modelling), by Emanuele Del Fava and Ziv Shkedy, in "Handbook of Infectious Disease Data Analysis", eds. L. Held, N. Hens, P. O'Neill, J. Walling, Chapman & Hall/CRC, 2019.

This repository contains the following material:
- Data for the analysis of two data sets from a pre-vaccination period (VZV in England and Wales, parvovirus B19 in Belgium), and one from a post-vaccination period (measles in Tuscany, Italy).
- Model files for the mixture models, written for JAGS.
- R codes for estimating the seroprevalence and (only for VZV and parvovirus B19) the force of infection, using Bayesian mixture models for antibody count data.
