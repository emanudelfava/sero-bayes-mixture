# Mixture modelling of serological data

Data and codes for replicating the analyses in:

Del Fava, E., & Shkedy, Z. (2020). Mixture Modelling. In L. Held, N. Hens, P. O'Neill, & J. Wallinga (Eds.), Handbook of Infectious Disease Data Analysis. Boca Raton, FL: Taylor & Francis Group.

This repository contains the following material:
- Data (in .csv) for the analysis of two data sets from a pre-vaccination period (VZV in England and Wales, parvovirus B19 in Belgium), and one from a post-vaccination period (measles in Tuscany, Italy).
- Models (in .txt) for the hierarchical Bayesian mixture models, written for JAGS.
- Codes (in .R) for estimating the seroprevalence and (only for VZV and parvovirus B19) the force of infection, using Bayesian mixture models for antibody count data.
